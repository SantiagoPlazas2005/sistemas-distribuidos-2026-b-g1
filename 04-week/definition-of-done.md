# Definition of Done (DoD)

> A User Story is **DONE** when it meets ALL the criteria in the checklist that applies to it.
> If even one criterion is missing, the story is NOT done and returns to "In Progress".
> This file has two checklists — code and documentation — because most of the
> project's stories so far are documentation, not code.

## Mandatory Checklist — Code Stories

### Code
- [ ] The code implements all acceptance criteria of the user story
- [ ] The code has been reviewed and approved by at least 1 team member (PR review)
- [ ] The code follows the project's standards (linting/formatting in CI, once a pipeline exists — until then, manual verification before merge)
- [ ] No technical debt is introduced without being recorded in `15-project-control/technical-backlog.md`

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests have been written for the new business logic (TDD: test before code)
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Acceptance criteria have been verified (manually or automatically)
- [ ] 🔵 Minimum coverage threshold: not yet defined by the team — must be set before the first real sprint of microservice implementation (Week 5 onward)

### Integration
- [ ] If the service calls another one (Sales→Customers, Sales→Products, or any service→Auth to validate the JWT), that real HTTP call was tested manually, not only with mocks
- [ ] If there are API changes: the OpenAPI contract in `07-api/contracts/` has been updated
- [ ] If there are changes to the data model: `06-data/models.md` has been updated for the affected schema
- [ ] If there are new or modified domain events: `02-domain/domain-events.md` has been updated (note: `09-microservices/event-catalog.md` only applies if the team adopts the optional asynchronous-messaging phase via RabbitMQ mentioned in ADR-001 — it does not apply today)

### Deployment
- [ ] The code is mergeable into the development branch of the corresponding repo: `dev` in the future real microservice repos (`auth-service`, `customers-service`, `products-service`, `sales-service`), or `develop` specifically in the `synkro-tech` MVP repo for this Corte 1
- [ ] CI/CD is green on the branch, once the pipeline exists (not yet configured — until then, the team runs `docker-compose up` locally and verifies manually)
- [ ] It runs correctly Locally via Docker Compose (today this is the only real validation environment — Staging/`qa` is planned but not yet provisioned, per `01-context/overview.md`; the `qa` smoke test becomes mandatory once that environment exists)

### Documentation
- [ ] The service's `README.md` has been updated if the public interface changed
- [ ] If a significant new technical decision was made, a new ADR was created (e.g., `ADR-002-*.md`) — **`ADR-001` is never edited**, since it is immutable once accepted

## Mandatory Checklist — Documentation Stories

For stories whose deliverable is a `.md` file in the `docs` repo (governance,
context, domain, product, UX-UI, architecture decisions), with no code
component:

- [ ] The document meets the minimum content expected by that section's template, with no blank sections and no unfilled `[bracket]` or `#[hex]` placeholders
- [ ] If the file already existed and was already graded by the professor, the previous content was not modified — only new content was added
- [ ] It does not duplicate content that already exists in another file in the repo (it was referenced instead of repeated)
- [ ] It is consistent with the other existing documents (no contradictions — especially against `ADR-001` and `02-domain/entities-and-rules.md`)
- [ ] It has been reviewed by at least one other team member
- [ ] It is marked as completed in `04-requirements/user-stories.md`, with the English translation already pushed to `main`

---

## Allowed Exceptions

The following exceptions must be explicitly agreed upon by the team:
- E2E tests omitted due to environment limitations (document the risk)
- Documentation deferred due to an urgent delivery (create a technical debt ticket in `15-project-control/technical-backlog.md`)

---

## What Is NOT a "Done" Criterion

- "The code is on my machine" — it must be in the repository
- "It works in my local environment" — it must work Locally via Docker Compose following the README, not only on the machine of whoever wrote it
- "The professor approved it in class" — that is the Definition of Done for the product, not for the code or the document
